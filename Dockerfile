# Two stages: a full toolchain to build, and a distroless image that holds the
# binary and nothing else. No shell, no package manager, no root; the same
# image runs the server and, as an init container, `simple-host migrate`.
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM keeps the toolchain native and cross-compiles to the
# target instead of emulating it. The binary is CGO-free, so Go does this for
# free; without it, building an amd64 image on an arm64 machine runs the whole
# Go toolchain under QEMU and takes minutes rather than seconds.
# Base images are pinned by digest so a rebuild uses the same bytes; Dependabot
# (.github/dependabot.yml) proposes digest bumps. golang:1.25.14 and
# distroless static:nonroot as of 2026-09-25.
